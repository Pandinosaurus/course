Editor howto
==============
The editor allows you obviously enter and modify text. Here you can develop your scripts, save them and execute. The editor supports Python syntax highlighting and shows line numbers (there is no ability to go to the line by number though). (above picture)

When typing, you can easily control indentation level (which is critical for Python code) using two buttons on the toolbar (1). Next buttons on the toolbar are Save and Save As (2), then goes Run (3), Undo, Search, Recent Files and Settings buttons. Also there are two buttons on the top: Open and New (5).

When saving, don’t forget to add .py estension to the file name since the editor don’t do it for you.
