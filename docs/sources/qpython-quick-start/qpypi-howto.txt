QPYPI howto
=============
Third libraries could extend your programming abilities greatly, QPython manage libraries through QPYPI, There are some ways to use QPYPI well.

Tools
-------
Tools category contains the useful tools for QPython, which could help you install QPython applications (Like SQLMap tool, Fabric tool and so on) easily, offer help for programming (Like django manage script, QEditor WebApp, Scapy tool and so on), and we will keep to improve more tools.

By using QPython's builtin pip console, you could install many Python libraries, it can help you install many pure-python libraries (including the dependencies).

Notice: Some libraries mixed with c/c++ files could not be install through pip console for the android lacks the compiler environment, you could ask help from qpython developer team.

Libraries
----------
In libraries, you could manage some Python libraries which directly maintained by QPython team. There are some libraries which you could not install with pip console, or written with c/c++ code that could not be compiled on android. Like kivy, paramiko, PIL, tornado etc. You could install them easily from here.

AIPY Libraries
------------------
In AIPY libraries, QPython team add the AI related programming libraries (like neural network, deeplearnning, data analysis and mathematical operation etc.), which help users start the AI programming learning with QPython's help easliy.

Manage Manually
-----------------
Besides these ways above, you could copy libraries into the /sdcard/qpython/lib/python2.7/site-packages in your device to install them.
